    Terms and Conditions of Use
    
Vacanza Greece and Cyprus Platform

Effective date: 4 September, 2025.

<h1><b>1. Parties, Platform and Contact Details</b></h1>

<span><b>1.1.</b></span> The Vacanza platform available at https://vacanzagreece.gr/ is operated by A.J. Marketeers Ltd, a company incorporated in Cyprus, Tax Identification Number 60073521P. Trade name: Vacanza.

<span><b>1.2.</b></span> For customer support and general correspondence, you may contact Vacanza at 758/2, Athens, Greece, or by email at info@vacanza.gr. Legal notices should be delivered to the Cyprus address in Section 1.1, unless mandatory law allows consumers to use their local forums and channels.

<span><b>1.3.</b></span> Vacanza operates a home exchange membership service. Members create profiles, search for listings, and may enter into reciprocal or non-reciprocal home exchange arrangements with other members. Vacanza does not own, manage, or control the properties listed by members. Vacanza does not become a party to exchange agreements concluded between members.

<span><b>1.4.</b></span> Acceptance. By creating an account, purchasing a membership, or otherwise using the Platform, you accept these Terms and Conditions, including policies incorporated by reference. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

<h1><b>2. Role of Vacanza and Nature of the Service</b></h1>

<span><b>2.1.</b></span> Intermediary function. Vacanza provides an online interface that enables members to discover each other and to negotiate and conclude home exchange arrangements. Vacanza is not a real estate agent, property manager, insurer, travel agent, or escrow provider.

<span><b>2.2.</b></span>No agency. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchise relationship is created between Vacanza and any user by virtue of the Terms or use of the Platform.

<span><b>2.3.</b></span> Member-to-member contracts. Any exchange contract arises solely between the members involved. Members are exclusively responsible for agreeing dates, occupancy limits, conditions of stay, allocation of utilities, key handling, and any other terms. Members are also responsible for verifying the identity and reliability of their counterparts, and for complying with tenancy, condominium, landlord, zoning, taxation, and short-stay rules applicable to the property.

<span><b>2.4.</b></span> No verification duty. Vacanza does not perform legal due diligence on listings or member contracts. Members must confirm that offering their property for exchange is permitted under their lease, condominium rules, mortgage terms, local housing laws, or other restrictions.

<span><b>2.5.</b></span> Third-party services. Airlines, ferry operators, car rental agencies, insurers, cleaning companies, and other third-party providers are independent of Vacanza. Vacanza offers no warranty regarding third-party services and assumes no liability for their performance.

3. Eligibility and Account Rules
3.1. Age and capacity. Users must be at least 18 years old and have legal capacity to contract.
3.2. Authority to list. By publishing a listing, you represent that you are the owner of the property or have documented permission from the owner or landlord to offer the property for home exchange. You are solely responsible for ensuring that an exchange is lawful in your jurisdiction.
3.3. Accurate information. Users shall provide accurate and current information in their profiles and listings, including address, occupancy limits, and any material defects or risks in the property.
3.4. Account security. Each account is personal. Sharing login credentials is prohibited. Access is limited to a maximum of 2 devices per account unless otherwise permitted in writing. Users must implement reasonable security measures and notify Vacanza without delay of any suspected unauthorized access.
3.5. Guest registration and compliance. Members must register guests or occupants with local authorities where such registration is required and must observe local public order and safety rules, building regulations, and homeowners association rules.
3.6. Prohibited conduct. Users shall not:
(a) create or participate in unauthorized user groups on social media or messaging platforms that coordinate off-platform exchanges or promote alternative booking channels without Vacanza’s written consent;
(b) charge any fee to other users for access to listings, introductions, or exchange confirmations;
(c) scrape, decompile, interfere with, or misuse the Platform;
(d) upload unlawful, defamatory, or infringing content;
(e) discriminate on protected grounds contrary to applicable law.
3.7. Contractual liquidated damages for prohibited conduct. To protect the integrity of the Platform, engaging in conduct described in Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(b) gives Vacanza the right to charge liquidated damages of €10,000 or such other amount as Vacanza may determine in accordance with the seriousness and duration of the breach, in addition to suspension or termination under Section 15. For consumers, any claim for liquidated damages will be assessed for fairness and reasonableness under Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair contract terms, Greek Law 2251/1994 on Consumer Protection, and Cyprus Contract Law, Cap. 149, Section 74. Courts may reduce any excessive amount under Greek Civil Code Articles 404 to 409 and, in Cyprus, award reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount stipulated.
4. Membership Plans, Prices and Taxes
4.1. Plans. Vacanza offers paid memberships including a 1-year plan and a 2-year plan with features described on the checkout page. Membership enables you to access the community, search listings, send requests, and conduct unlimited exchanges during the active term, subject to these Terms.
4.2. Pricing. All prices are shown in Euro and include or exclude VAT as indicated at checkout. Vacanza may correct obvious pricing errors and may change prices prospectively. The price in effect at the time of your purchase applies to that transaction.
4.3. VAT and place of supply. For consumer members located in the EU, VAT is generally due based on the member’s location under Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 and related VAT rules for electronically supplied services. You authorize Vacanza to determine your location using reasonable evidence and to apply the appropriate VAT rate.
4.4. Auto-renewal. If an auto-renewal option is offered and selected, your membership renews for successive terms at the then-current price. You may cancel auto-renewal in your account settings at any time before the renewal date. Where required by law, Vacanza will send a reminder with clear cancellation instructions.
4.5. Invoicing and receipts. Vacanza will issue electronic invoices or receipts by email or through your account. You consent to electronic delivery.
5. Right of Withdrawal, Returns and Refunds
5.1. Nature of the service. Membership is a digital platform service. No tangible goods are supplied. Personalized goods are not sold via the Platform. Digital downloads, if any, form part of the service.
5.2. Statutory right of withdrawal for EU consumers. Under Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights as implemented in Greece by Law 2251/1994 and in Cyprus by Law 133(I)/2013, consumers who purchase a membership online generally have a 14-day right of withdrawal without stating reasons.
5.3. Exceptions regarding immediate performance of services.
(a) Services commencing during the withdrawal period. If you expressly request that your membership start immediately and acknowledge that you will lose the right of withdrawal once the service is fully performed, you may owe a proportionate amount for the service provided up to the time of withdrawal under Article 14 of Directive 2011/83/EU.
(b) Digital content not supplied on a tangible medium. If the membership or any included digital content is supplied immediately following your express consent and acknowledgment of loss of withdrawal rights, the right of withdrawal does not apply under Article 16(m) of Directive 2011/83/EU and Directive (EU) 2019/770 on digital content and digital services as transposed in Greek and Cypriot law.
5.4. Vacanza refund policy. Membership fees are non-refundable once the withdrawal right is not available or has been validly waived under Section 5.3. If you do not consent to immediate start, you may withdraw within 14 days from purchase by notifying Vacanza at info@vacanza.gr. Vacanza will reimburse payments received within 14 days using the original payment method, subject to any proportionate deduction allowed by law where service has begun at your request.
5.5. Exchanges and incidentals. Vacanza is not a party to exchange contracts and does not refund travel expenses, third-party fees, or costs for cleaning, utilities, deposits, repairs, or other incidentals arising between members. Members must address cancellations, date changes, and property condition matters directly in their exchange agreements.
5.6. Warranties and Magnuson-Moss. The U.S. Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2301 to 2312, applies to written warranties on consumer products in the United States. Vacanza does not sell consumer products and operates in Greece and Cyprus for EEA users. Magnuson-Moss is therefore inapplicable. Warranty and conformity matters, where relevant to digital services, are governed by Directive (EU) 2019/770, Greek implementing legislation, and Cypriot implementing legislation.
5.7. Local consumer entitlements. Mandatory consumer rights under Greek and Cypriot law remain unaffected. Any contractual clause is interpreted to preserve those rights, including the right to remedies for lack of conformity in digital services within statutory periods.
5.8. How to exercise withdrawal. To withdraw within 14 days where the right applies, send a clear statement by email to info@vacanza.gr or by mail to the Cyprus address in Section 1.1. You may use the model withdrawal form in Annex I(B) to Directive 2011/83/EU or any unequivocal statement. Include your name, address, email, order number, and date of purchase.
6. Listings, Content and Intellectual Property
6.1. User content license. By uploading text, photographs, floor plans, or other content, you grant Vacanza a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, adapt, and translate such content for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Platform, for the duration of your rights.
6.2. Your warranties. You represent that you own or have secured rights to all content you upload and that your content does not infringe third-party rights, including copyright, trademark, privacy or publicity rights.
6.3. Platform IP. The structure, layout, source code, plug-ins, concept, design elements, and trademarks including “Vacanza” are owned or licensed by A.J. Marketeers Ltd and protected under copyright and industrial property laws. No license is granted except as necessary to use the Platform in accordance with these Terms.
6.4. Reporting infringement. Rights holders may submit notices of alleged infringement to info@vacanza.gr with sufficient detail for identification of the content and proof of rights. Vacanza may remove or disable access where appropriate and may notify the uploader.
7. Intermediary, E-Commerce and DSA Disclosures
7.1. E-commerce compliance. Vacanza complies with the EU E-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC as implemented in Greece by Presidential Decree 131/2003 and in Cyprus by Law 156(I)/2004. Pre-contractual disclosures are provided at checkout, including identity, pricing, and technical steps to conclude a contract.
7.2. Digital Services Act. As a hosting service provider under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, Vacanza maintains a notice-and-action mechanism to report illegal content, provides clear terms on moderation measures, and will inform users of significant changes to these Terms. Users may appeal moderation decisions through internal complaint handling as described in Section 16.
7.3. Platform-to-Business transparency. Where professional hosts use the Platform in a business capacity, Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 applies. Ranking parameters, if any, are disclosed in a concise explanation on the listing pages. Professional hosts must identify themselves as traders and comply with consumer information duties.
8. Safety, Condition, and House Rules
8.1. Disclosure duty. Hosts shall disclose relevant safety information, including hazards, building works, pool safety, gas or electrical issues, and neighborhood restrictions.
8.2. Insurance. Members are responsible for obtaining suitable homeowner, renter, or personal liability insurance covering home exchanges. Vacanza does not provide insurance or guarantees.
8.3. Keys and access. Hosts remain responsible for key management and access instructions, including re-keying or access code changes after an exchange if desired.
8.4. Cleaning and maintenance. Members should set expectations regarding cleaning, linens, and post-stay condition in their member-to-member agreement. Photographs of the property condition before and after the stay are recommended.
9. Reviews and Ratings
9.1. Authenticity. Reviews must reflect genuine experiences. Manipulation, coercion, or review exchanges unrelated to actual stays are prohibited.
9.2. Moderation. Vacanza may refuse or remove reviews that contain unlawful content, personal data of third parties, or irrelevant commercial promotions.
9.3. License to display. By submitting a review, you grant Vacanza the right to display, translate, and excerpt the review for Platform operation and user guidance.
10. Payments and Processing
10.1. Payment services. Vacanza may use third-party payment processors. You authorize charges for membership fees, taxes, and any other amounts you approve in your account.
10.2. Currency and conversion. Charges are processed in Euro unless otherwise indicated. Your bank may apply exchange rates and fees.
10.3. Chargebacks. If you dispute a charge without valid grounds, Vacanza may suspend your account pending resolution.
11. Cancellation, No-Shows, and Member Disputes
11.1. Member cancellations. Where a member cancels an agreed exchange, the parties must resolve the matter between themselves. Vacanza may, at its discretion, provide communication assistance but does not provide reimbursements or alternative accommodations.
11.2. Security deposits between members. If members agree to a deposit, they must specify the amount, conditions for deductions, documentation requirements, and return timelines in their exchange agreement.
11.3. Misconduct. Serious misconduct, property damage, or safety incidents should be reported to local authorities. Vacanza may suspend accounts implicated in credible reports.
12. Legal Compliance and Taxation
12.1. Housing and stay rules. Members must comply with any registration, short-term stay, or exchange restrictions under local laws in Greece and Cyprus, including condominium bylaws and landlord approvals where applicable.
12.2. Taxes. Members are responsible for any taxes arising from providing or receiving accommodation, including income taxes or municipal fees. Vacanza does not provide tax advice.
13. Liability, Disclaimers, and Indemnity
13.1. No guarantee of exchanges. Vacanza does not guarantee that a member will complete or accept an exchange or that a property will meet expectations.
13.2. Service availability. Platform availability may be interrupted for maintenance, updates, or events outside Vacanza’s control. Reasonable efforts will be made to restore service.
13.3. Limitation of liability. To the maximum extent permitted by Greek and Cypriot law, Vacanza and its affiliates are not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of profits, loss of data, or reputational harm arising from use of the Platform or from member-to-member exchanges. Nothing limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, for fraud, or for any liability that cannot be excluded under mandatory law.
13.4. Consumer protections preserved. Mandatory consumer rights under Greek Law 2251/1994 and Cypriot consumer legislation remain unaffected.
13.5. Indemnity. Users shall indemnify and hold harmless Vacanza from claims by third parties arising from their breach of these Terms, infringement of rights, or violation of law in connection with their listings or exchanges, except where such claims result from Vacanza’s own breach of mandatory duties.

15.3. Notice. Where feasible, Vacanza will provide prior notice of suspension with reasons and instructions for appeal. Immediate suspension may occur in urgent cases to protect users or comply with legal orders.

4.2. Automatically through the service. System logs, cookies and similar technologies, and telemetry from our applications, subject to consent where required.

5. Purposes and Legal Bases
Vacanza processes personal data only where a legal basis under Articles 6 and 9 GDPR applies. Typical purposes and bases include:
5.1. Account creation and platform operation. To register users, authenticate logins, host listings, operate search and messaging, and enable member-to-member exchanges. Legal basis: performance of a contract or steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
5.2. Membership billing and tax compliance. To process membership fees, issue invoices, apply VAT rules for electronically supplied services, maintain accounting records, and comply with audits. Legal basis: performance of a contract, Article 6(1)(b), and legal obligation under EU and national tax and accounting laws, Article 6(1)(c).
5.3. Safety, integrity and misuse prevention. To protect users and the service, detect fraud or abusive behavior, limit unauthorized account sharing, and investigate breaches of terms. Legal basis: legitimate interests, Article 6(1)(f). Where local law requires a specific legal obligation, Article 6(1)(c) may also apply.
5.4. Customer support and dispute handling. To respond to requests, provide guidance, and reasonably document interactions. Legal basis: Article 6(1)(b) and, where relevant, Article 6(1)(f).
5.5. Communications. To send service notices, policy updates, and transactional messages necessary for the service, Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f). Direct marketing by electronic means will be sent only with your consent, Article 6(1)(a), or, where permitted, under the so-called soft opt-in for similar products to existing customers, always with an easy opt-out as required by ePrivacy rules in Greece and Cyprus. 
5.6. Consent-based features. Optional activities such as optional newsletters or certain analytics and remarketing cookies rely on consent, Article 6(1)(a). You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior processing.
5.7. Legal claims and compliance. To establish, exercise, or defend legal claims, to respond to lawful requests from authorities, and to maintain records required by law. Legal basis: Article 6(1)(c) and Article 6(1)(f).
5.8. Automated decision-making. Vacanza does not make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects based solely on automated processing as referred to in Article 22 GDPR. Ranking and matching features use standard relevance signals and do not produce such effects.
6. Recipients and International Transfers
6.1. Recipients. Personal data may be shared with the following categories of recipients, each acting as processor or independent controller, as applicable: hosting and cloud infrastructure providers, payment processors, fraud and security vendors, customer support platforms, email and notification services, analytics vendors with consent, external auditors, and competent authorities where legally required. Upon request, we will provide a current list of processors.
6.2. Intra-group and EEA processing. Data is primarily processed within the EEA. If processing occurs outside the EEA or the United Kingdom, we implement appropriate safeguards.
6.3. Transfers to third countries. For transfers to countries without an adequacy decision, Vacanza uses the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, accompanied by transfer risk assessments and technical measures consistent with EDPB guidance. 
7. Retention
7.1. General rule. Data is retained only as long as necessary for the purpose collected, then deleted or anonymized, subject to statutory archiving duties.
7.2. Typical time frames.
(a) Account and profile data. Stored for the life of the account and for 24 months after closure to address post-termination issues, unless legal claims require longer storage.
(b) Contracts, invoices and accounting records. Retained to meet record-keeping obligations. In Greece, standard retention for books and records is commonly 5 years. In Cyprus, VAT and accounting laws require retention for at least 6 years. 
(c) Security logs. Typically 12 months, extended where needed to investigate incidents.
(d) Marketing preferences and consent records. Stored for the period we send communications and for the applicable limitation period to evidence compliance.
7.3. Litigation holds. If reasonably necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims, relevant data may be retained beyond the standard period until the matter concludes.
8. Security
8.1. Measures. Vacanza applies technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including access controls, encryption in transit, segmentation of production systems, vulnerability management, and staff confidentiality undertakings. Vendors are vetted for appropriate security.
8.2. Breach response. We assess incidents promptly. Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to individuals, notification to the competent supervisory authority will occur without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours as contemplated by Article 33 GDPR, with communication to affected individuals where required by Article 34.

9.3. Erasure. Request deletion in the circumstances set out in Article 17.
9.4. Restriction. Request restriction of processing in the cases provided by Article 18.

9.7. Consent withdrawal. Withdraw consent at any time where processing relies on consent.
9.8. Complaint. Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority as identified in Section 1.4. 
10. How to Exercise Your Rights

10.2. Response time. We respond without undue delay and in any event within 1 month of receipt. Complex requests may take up to 3 months as permitted by Article 12(3) GDPR. If we cannot comply, we will explain the reasons and your options.
10.3. Fees. Requests are handled free of charge unless manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act, consistent with Article 12(5) GDPR.
11. Marketing Communications
11.1. Consent and soft opt-in. We send electronic marketing only with your prior consent or, where permitted by local ePrivacy rules, to existing customers about services similar to those already purchased, subject to an easy opt-out. Cookie-based marketing requires prior consent in Greece and Cyprus. 
11.2. Opt-out. Every marketing message includes an unsubscribe mechanism. You may also change preferences in your account.

12. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
12.1. Overview. The site uses strictly necessary cookies for security and core functionality, and, where you consent, analytics and similar tools. Technical details, identities of providers, purposes, retention times, and consent options are set out in the Cookie Policy.
12.2. ePrivacy compliance. Non-essential cookies are set only after consent consistent with Article 4(11) GDPR and national ePrivacy provisions cited above. Records of consent are maintained.
13. Disclosures for Member-to-Member Exchanges
13.1. Visibility of profile elements. Certain profile fields, listing photos, and availability indicators are visible to other members to enable discovery and negotiation. Messaging content is visible to the counterparties and to Vacanza personnel or authorized processors where necessary for security, support, compliance, or dispute handling.
13.2. Independent controllers. Payment processors and some anti-fraud services act as independent controllers for their processing. Their policies explain how they handle your data. Links are provided at checkout or in-flow.
14. International Users and One-Stop-Shop
14.1. Cross-border processing. Because our service targets users in Greece and Cyprus and may be accessible from other EEA countries, cross-border processing can occur. Where applicable, Vacanza will rely on the GDPR one-stop-shop mechanism with the competent lead supervisory authority based on our main establishment, without limiting your right to complain to your local authority.
15. Data Protection by Design and Default
15.1. Product lifecycle. Privacy is addressed in product and engineering processes through access governance, data minimization, and periodic reviews of high-risk features. When required, data protection impact assessments are conducted under Article 35 GDPR, and consultation with supervisory authorities is sought under Article 36 where appropriate.
16. Record of Processing Activities
16.1. Documentation. Vacanza maintains a record of processing activities under Article 30 GDPR, including categories of data, purposes, recipients, retention periods, and safeguards for international transfers. Summaries may be provided to authorities upon request.

17. Retention Details for Specific Items
17.1. Membership contracts and invoices. Retained as required by accounting and tax law. In Greece, a 5-year standard limitation period influences record retention; in Cyprus, VAT and corporate record-keeping require at least 6 years. 
17.2. Consent logs for cookies and marketing. Stored while the relevant cookie category is active and for a subsequent period necessary to demonstrate compliance.
17.3. Support and complaints. Stored for the period needed to resolve the issue and for limitation periods applicable to civil claims.
18. Changes to This Policy
18.1. We may update this policy to reflect changes in operations or law. Significant changes will be communicated through the service or by email before they take effect. Continued use after the effective date indicates acknowledgment of the updated policy.

Effective date: 4 September, 2025
1. Purpose and Scope
1.1. This Cookie Policy explains how A.J. Marketeers Ltd, trading as Vacanza, uses cookies and similar technologies on www.vacanzagreece.gr and related interfaces. Processing of personal data that may result from these technologies is carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC as implemented in Greece by Law 3471/2006 and in Cyprus by Law 112(I)/2004, and any other applicable national provisions.
1.2. The Policy applies to visitors and registered members. It should be read together with the GDPR Privacy Policy, which sets out the identity of the controller, contact details, data subject rights, and international transfer safeguards.
2. What Cookies Are
2.1. Cookies are small text files placed on a device by a website. They may be session cookies, which expire when the browser is closed, or persistent cookies, which remain for a defined period.
2.2. Related technologies include local storage, session storage, SDKs in mobile applications, pixels, and tags that can serve similar purposes. For simplicity, references to cookies in this Policy cover those technologies where relevant.
3. Legal Bases
3.1. Storing or accessing information on a user’s device for non-essential purposes requires prior consent under ePrivacy rules. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and signified by a clear affirmative action.
3.2. Strictly necessary cookies that are required to provide a service explicitly requested by the user may be used without consent. Processing of personal data arising from necessary cookies relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or, where appropriate, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Non-essential cookies rely on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
4. How Consent Is Collected and Recorded
4.1. The site presents a consent banner at first visit and whenever material changes occur. Users can accept all categories, reject all optional categories, or select categories individually.
4.2. Vacanza records the user’s consent choices and the timestamp of the decision. The system honors those choices on subsequent visits, unless the user clears cookies or modifies preferences.
4.3. Consent can be withdrawn at any time using the methods in Section 8. Withdrawal takes effect for future operations.
5. Categories of Cookies We Use
5.1. Strictly necessary. Enable core features such as page navigation, account authentication, load balancing, and security. These are essential for the service to function. Consent is not required.
5.2. Preferences. Remember choices such as language or display settings. These enhance usability. Consent is required unless the preference is indispensable to deliver a service specifically requested by the user.
5.3. Analytics and measurement. Help understand how the site is used, for example, pages visited, time on page, and navigation paths. Data are aggregated or pseudonymized where feasible. Consent is required before setting analytics cookies.
5.4. Marketing and social media. Facilitate the delivery of advertising or the integration of third-party social features. These cookies track users across sites or sessions. Consent is required.
6. Current Cookie Inventory
6.1. Vacanza currently operates a minimal set of cookies. The table below lists each cookie known to be active as of the Effective date. The inventory may evolve as the service develops. Any addition of non-essential cookies will be introduced only after obtaining consent.

e.g., “en”, “el”, “it”

6.2. Operational notes. The i18nextLng cookie does not by itself identify a person. If combined with account data or other identifiers, it may become personal data. Processing in that case follows the GDPR Privacy Policy.
7. Third-Party Tools
7.1. If third-party analytics or marketing tools are introduced in the future, they will appear in the consent banner with clear labeling. Vendors will be listed by name, with links to their disclosures, and each cookie will be mapped to a category.
7.2. Where third-country transfers arise, Vacanza will implement appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, together with supplementary technical and organizational measures as appropriate.
8. Managing Cookies and Withdrawing Consent
8.1. On-site controls. Use the Cookie settings link in the footer or the banner to revisit and modify your choices at any time.
8.2. Browser controls. Most browsers allow users to block or delete cookies. Instructions are available in the help pages for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others. Blocking all cookies may impair site functionality.
8.3. Mobile settings. Device-level settings can restrict identifiers used by mobile apps. If Vacanza releases a mobile app, in-app controls will be provided.
8.4. Withdrawal of consent. When consent is withdrawn, previously stored non-essential cookies will be disabled where technically possible. Users may also delete cookies through their browser to remove existing files.
9. Consequences of Refusing Cookies
9.1. Refusing strictly necessary cookies is not possible through the banner because those cookies are needed to deliver content and maintain security.
9.2. Refusing preference, analytics, or marketing cookies may affect personalization, measurement quality, or the relevance of communications. Core navigation and account access will remain available.
10. Data Collected Through Cookies
10.1. Depending on category, cookies may collect pseudonymous identifiers, device information, approximate geolocation inferred from IP, session timestamps, and interaction events. Analytics data are aggregated whenever viable. Personal data, if any, are processed in accordance with the GDPR Privacy Policy.
10.2. Retention aligns with the durations in the cookie table. For analytics and marketing tools introduced later, retention will be limited to what is necessary, subject to the user’s consent status and applicable limitation periods.
11. International Transfers and Security
11.1. Personal data derived from cookies are mainly processed within the EEA. If a provider processes data outside the EEA or the United Kingdom, Vacanza will ensure an adequate legal mechanism is in place.
11.2. Technical and organizational measures include TLS encryption in transit, access controls, and periodic security reviews of vendors.
12. Special Circumstances
12.1. Do Not Track signals. Industry standards for DNT are not uniform. The site honors explicit consent choices made through the banner. Where the browser or the operating system supports Global Privacy Control signals compatible with EU consent requirements, support may be added and will be described here when implemented.
12.2. Children. The service targets adults. Cookies are not used to profile minors to the best of our knowledge.
13. Changes to This Policy
13.1. Material changes to categories, vendors, or purposes will be communicated through the banner or by notice on the site, along with refreshed consent where required.
13.2. The cookie table will be updated to reflect the current state. Prior versions can be provided upon request.
